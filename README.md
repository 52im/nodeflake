NodeFlake
=========

Like twitters SnowFlake, but made with NodeJS. 



Why?
----

Because it was there. 



Goals
-----

Generate unique ids without need for a stored seed.
Ids should be mostly sortable by time/order
5k ids per second (half of SnowFlake)
Fast response and high availability (numbers laters)
